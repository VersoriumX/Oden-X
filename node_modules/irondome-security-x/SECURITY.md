# IronDomeSecurity Security Policy

## Overview

The IronDomeSecurity project is committed to maintaining the highest standards of security for our codebase, user data, and overall project integrity. This document outlines the security practices, reporting procedures, and guidelines for contributors to follow.

## Security Practices

1. **Code Reviews**: 
   - All code contributions must undergo a thorough review process. Reviewers should check for security vulnerabilities, code quality, and adherence to project standards.

2. **Dependency Management**: 
   - Regularly update dependencies to their latest stable versions. Use tools like `npm audit` for JavaScript and `pip-audit` for Python to identify vulnerabilities in dependencies.

3. **Environment Variables**: 
   - Sensitive information, such as API keys and database credentials, must be stored in environment variables and not hard-coded in the source code. Use `.env` files for local development and ensure they are included in the `.gitignore`.

4. **Access Control**: 
   - Limit access to sensitive parts of the codebase. Use GitHub's branch protection rules to enforce reviews and restrict who can merge changes into the main branch.

5. **Logging and Monitoring**: 
   - Implement logging for critical actions and monitor logs for suspicious activity. Ensure that logs do not contain sensitive information.

6. **Input Validation**: 
   - Validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks and other vulnerabilities. Use libraries and frameworks that provide built-in validation mechanisms.

7. **Security Testing**: 
   - Regularly conduct security testing, including static code analysis, dynamic analysis, and penetration testing, to identify and remediate vulnerabilities.

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability in the IronDomeSecurity project, please follow these steps:

1. **Do Not Create Public Issues**: 
   - Please do not disclose security vulnerabilities publicly. Instead, report them privately.

2. **Contact Information**: 
   - Send an email to [security@versoriumx.com](mailto:security@versoriumx.com) with the following information:
     - A description of the vulnerability
     - Steps to reproduce the issue
     - Any relevant screenshots or logs

3. **Response Time**: 
   - We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and aim to provide a resolution or further information within a reasonable timeframe.

## Contributor Guidelines

All contributors to the IronDomeSecurity project are expected to adhere to the following guidelines:

- Follow secure coding practices and be aware of common security vulnerabilities (e.g., OWASP Top Ten).
- Participate in security training and awareness programs as needed.
- Report any suspicious activity or potential security issues to the project maintainers immediately.

## Conclusion

By following this security policy, we can work together to ensure the IronDomeSecurity project remains secure and trustworthy. Thank you for your commitment to maintaining the security of our project.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.
